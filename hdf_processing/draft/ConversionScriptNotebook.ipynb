    "MAIAC data is available from a number of sources online. We obtained the files using the [DAAC2Disk Web Tool](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/tools/data_access/daac2disk_web), as it provided a way to intantly request and download multiple years' worth of MAIAC data instantly, rather than having to wait until a request is processed for up to a week as with Earthdata. Chicago is located in the MAIAC Sinusoidal tile (H04,V11). This script was executed on a folder containing all MAIAC files for that tile from 2016 and took around ten minutes to convert 2. "

It extracts only the Optical Depth 47 subdataset from a given HDF, but it can be easily modified to do the same with the quality assurance subdataset or create a multi-band Geotiff consisiting of all MAIAC layers.
